## Investigating the Relationship Between Carbon Emissions and Climate Change

This project investigates the relationship between carbon emissions and climate change. Carbon emissions are known to be a leading contributor to climate change, which has significant impacts on the environment and human society. Therefore, understanding the relationship between these two variables is crucial.

### Background and Motivation

This project is the final project for the CMSE 202 course. The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between carbon emissions and climate change. Our group members for this project are Peter Fu Chen, Riley Millikan, Mike Liu, Alex Tran, and Trevor Parcella.

### Project Overview

Our goals for this project include:

Analyzing historical trends in carbon emissions and climate change.
Examining the relationship between carbon emissions and various climate variables.
Drawing conclusions about the impact of carbon emissions on climate change.

### Methodology

The following methodology will be used in the project:

- Data collection and cleaning: historical data on carbon emissions and climate variables will be collected and cleaned using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.
- Data analysis: various statistical and machine learning techniques will be used to analyze the relationship between carbon emissions and climate variables. Linear regression models will be trained to predict the impact of carbon emissions on climate variables.
- Visualization: data visualizations will be created using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate the relationship between carbon emissions and climate variables.
- Conclusion: based on the analysis and visualizations, conclusions will be drawn about the impact of carbon emissions on climate change.
