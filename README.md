# How have carbon emissions affected climate change?

Group member: 
Riley Millikan, 
Mike Liu

This project is the final project for the CMSE 202 course. The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between carbon emissions and climate change. Our group members for this project are Riley Millikan and Mike Liu.

Project Overview
Carbon emissions are one of the main contributors to climate change. As such, it is important to understand the relationship between the two. In this project, we will explore various aspects of carbon emissions and climate change, such as the relationship between carbon emissions and rising temperatures, the impact of carbon emissions on extreme weather events, and the role of carbon emissions in sea level rise.

Data Sources
We will be using various sources of data to investigate the impact of carbon emissions on climate change. Some of the data sources we plan to use include:

- NOAA's Global Climate Dashboard (https://www.climate.gov/maps-data)
- NASA's Global Climate Change (https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/)
- IPCC reports (https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/)
- World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)

Our goals for this project include:

Analyzing historical trends in carbon emissions and climate change
Examining the relationship between carbon emissions and various climate variables, such as temperature, extreme weather events, sea level, and ocean acidity
Creating visualizations to illustrate our findings
Drawing conclusions about the impact of carbon emissions on climate change


We can compare the carbon emission with:

Sea level

Ocean acidification
