# How have carbon emissions affected climate change?

### Background and Motivation

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship between carbon emissions and climate change. Carbon emissions are known to be a leading contributor to climate change, which has significant impacts on the environment and human society. Therefore, understanding the relationship between these two variables is crucial. 

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the historical trends of carbon emissions and climate change, specifically examining the relationship between carbon emissions and rising temperatures, the impact of carbon emissions on extreme weather events, and the role of carbon emissions in sea level rise.

### Methodology

The following methodology will be used in the project:

- Data collection and cleaning: historical data on carbon emissions and climate variables will be collected and cleaned using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.
- Data analysis: various statistical and machine learning techniques will be used to analyze the relationship between carbon emissions and climate variables. Linear regression models will be trained to predict the impact of carbon emissions on climate variables.
- Visualization: data visualizations will be created using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate the relationship between carbon emissions and climate variables.
- Conclusion: based on the analysis and visualizations, conclusions will be drawn about the impact of carbon emissions on climate change.
